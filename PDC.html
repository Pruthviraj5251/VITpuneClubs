  <h2>Team PDC</h2>
<p>The Personality Development Club in our college was born from a profound aspiration to shape students into well-rounded individuals equipped with character, competence, and cultural understanding.
Our objective was to help
students to deal sensitivity and self-awareness in thought, words and action and save themselves from self-destructing habits and addiction that harm body and mind. Our objectives includes creating a class of people of high character and competence, training students in right values, etiquette, behavior and practices and much more!The club smoothly navigated the pandemic by shifting to virtual platforms for studies and events. This adversity brought opportunities, allowing a larger student participation globally. We conducted enriching sessions with alumni worldwide.
While memorable, we missed physical gatherings and snacks. Adapting was challenging, yet a highlight of our journey, showcasing resilience and innovation.</p>
