<p>Antariksh Club VI was formed with the sole idea of bringing together and forming a community of like-minded individuals and enthusiasts, who would come together to connect, collaborate, explore, and share their knowledge in the field of Astronomy and Space Science.VIT's Astronomy Club, Antariksh, recently hosted a series of enriching events to enhance its members' knowledge and skills. These included an astrophotography workshop, where attendees honed their celestial photography skills.We also celebrated Chandrayaan -3 Mahotsav, commemorating Indias remarkable lunar exploration feat. Engaging astronomy talks, featuring expert insights, captivated our audience, while lively star parties and captivating stargazing events fostered community engagement.
