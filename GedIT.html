  <h2>Team GedIT</h2>
<p>GedIT Coding Club is a student-led community dedicated to fostering a culture of peer-to-peer learning among its members. Our aim is to create an enthusiastic and motivated environment where students freely share knowledge without hindrance or barriers.GedIT Coding Club conducts regular sessions on topics important to the IT industry, such as Data Structures and various Programming Languages, taught by expert students themselves. Aside from this, GedIT conducts seminars on topics such as placements and higher education. CodeClash '24 was organised by GedIT Coding Club to help students familiarise themselves with online contests. Sessions such as Getting Familiar with GitHub helped students learn tools used in the industry which are not typically taught..</p>
